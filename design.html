    <p>reason for this is because i like design that is creative and
        fenctional and captures the attention of the public as well as it 
        being a creative problem that requires of reaching an demographic 
        of public sell,promote,campaign,socialise.this is used to create 
        an atmosphere or a message for the public to discuss or consume. "
