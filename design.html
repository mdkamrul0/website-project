    <p>reason for this is because i like design that is creative and
        fenctional and captures the attention of the public as well as it 
        being a creative problem that requires of reaching an demographic 
        of public sell,promote,campaign,socialise.this is used to create 
        an atmosphere or a message for the public to discuss or consume. 
    </p>

    <P>design can be seen everywhere if you have a passion for seeing it 
        persnally like noticing the visual art, messaging that someone or 
        orginision have broadcasted through differnt aplication i can list 
        a few however there are many.
