    <p>the reason for this because as said before it is a creative problem
        that requires the reach of a demographic to sell,promote,socialise
        howere the difference is that this method is a little more complex 
        because you need the right know how to create written code than can 
        be uses create  and can go hand in hand with being interactive with 
        design.
